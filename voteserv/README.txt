This is a hacky little program to do fair voting.  I wrote it
to pick a name for the 2016 Girls Who Code domain.  It was made
by haking simples (http://simples.jovial.com/).  It doesn't take
any command-line arguments; everything is just hard-coded in,
since I'm planning to run it in the IDE in class anyway.
