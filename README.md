# misc
Miscellaneous small-ish bits of code, mostly for my own use, but you're 
welcome to it.  This repository contains:

    hd.java
        Minimal hex dump

    JsonPretty.java
        A minimal JSON pretty-printer

    rocket.c
        Controller for the RocketFM transmitter

    scurses
        A screen form creation library in Java, built on curses.
        This re-creates a framework I called "screen" that I used for
        commercial projects on Xenix back in the early 90's.

    voteserv
        An http server to do fair voting.
        See voteserv/src/Main.kt for a description.

    flower
        An ancient, partial UML design tool written in Eiffel and Tcl/Tk

    baudsim
        A cheezy program to simulate a slow serial connection
