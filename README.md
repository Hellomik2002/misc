# misc
Miscellaneous small-ish bits of code, mostly for my own use, but you're 
welcome to it.  This repository contains:

    JsonPretty.java
    	A minimal JSON pretty-printer

    rocket.c
	Controller for the RocketFM transmitter

    scurses
	A screen form creation library in Java, built on curses.
	This re-creates a framework I called "screen" that I used for
	commercial projects on Xenix back in the early 90's.

    voteserv
	An http server to do fair voting.
	See voteserv/src/Main.kt for a description.
